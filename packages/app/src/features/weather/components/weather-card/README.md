# Weather Card Documentation

## Overview

The weather card is a single adaptive component that renders different information densities based on `CardSize`.

## Card Sizes

### Small

- Matches the medium card styling exactly
- Shows compact location header, temperature + H/L summary, condition icon, and a 4-day forecast strip
- Hides the detail metrics column and sunrise/sunset timeline

### Medium

- Shows compact location header, temperature + H/L summary, condition icon, and a 7-day forecast strip
- Hides the detail metrics column and sunrise/sunset timeline
- Forecast strip can switch between hourly and weekly from the settings dialog

### Large and Extra-Large

- Shows the detailed weather layout
- Includes detail metrics, sunrise/sunset timeline, and forecast row

## Props

interface WeatherCardProps {
  id: string;
  location: string;

  temperatureUnit?: TemperatureUnit;
  feelsLikeTemperature?: number;
  feelsLikeTemperatureUnit?: TemperatureUnit;

  forecastMode: WeatherForecastMode;
  highTemp: number;
  highTempUnit?: TemperatureUnit;
  lowTemp: number;
  lowTempUnit?: TemperatureUnit;
  size: CardSize;
  onSizeChange: (id: string, size: CardSize) => void;
  isEditMode: boolean;
}
```

## Design Notes

- Uses the shared `CardWrapper`
- Uses the same edit-mode size selector pattern as other dashboard cards
- Opens a settings dialog on card tap outside edit mode
- Keeps `large` / `extra-large` on the detailed layout path
- Uses the same compact header + forecast strip layout for both `small` and `medium`
- Uses Home Assistant source temperature units and converts display values through the shared
  temperature utilities
- Persists per-card tint color and shared weather settings through the controller/store layer
- Includes handcrafted dynamic weather illustration variants for:
  sunny day, clear night, cloudy, rain, storm, fog, snow day, snow night, windy, and fallback states
- The overlay atoms are split by weather effect; `weather-card-overlays.tsx` now only composes them

## Maintenance Notes

- Update this README when card size behavior changes
- If the component is split into subcomponents again, update the structure section to match the real folder contents
