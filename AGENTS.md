# Navet

Navet is a smart-home dashboard frontend with a package architecture direction built around
provider-neutral core and UI layers, provider packages, and an official app-composition layer.
Today it runs as a standalone Docker app, a Home Assistant add-on through Ingress, and a Home
Assistant custom panel. Home Assistant is the reference adapter today. Homey and openHAB are
implemented standalone providers. Hubitat and SmartThings currently have planned package and
registration surfaces only.

Current capability baseline:

- Home Assistant: rooms, lighting, sensors, climate, media, cameras, energy, calendar, weather,
  notifications, tasks, history, security, and provider administration
- Homey: rooms, realtime entities, lighting, switches, and sensors
- openHAB: rooms, realtime entities, lighting, switches, and sensors
- standalone Navet can retain multiple implemented provider sessions and aggregate selected
  providers in shared dashboard collections

## Required Reading

Before making changes, read [`/ai/agents.md`](ai/agents.md).

For architecture, state, provider, integration, auth/runtime, or larger refactor work, also read:

- [`/docs/agents/architecture.md`](docs/agents/architecture.md)
- [`/docs/architecture/package-boundaries.md`](docs/architecture/package-boundaries.md)
- [`/docs/architecture/provider-neutral-ui.md`](docs/architecture/provider-neutral-ui.md)
- [`/docs/architecture/provider-contract.md`](docs/architecture/provider-contract.md)
- [`/docs/architecture/home-assistant-decoupling-audit.md`](docs/architecture/home-assistant-decoupling-audit.md)
- [`/docs/testing/provider-testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing/provider-testing-strategy.md)
- [`/docs/roadmap/provider-platform-roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap/provider-platform-roadmap.md)

Read the relevant skill file for the area you are touching:

- Home Assistant entity behavior: [`/ai/skills/home-assistant-integration.md`](ai/skills/home-assistant-integration.md)
- Tests and test cleanup: [`/ai/skills/testing-architecture.md`](ai/skills/testing-architecture.md)
- Mock entities and fixtures: [`/ai/skills/entity-fixtures.md`](ai/skills/entity-fixtures.md)
- Authentication and deployment modes: [`/ai/skills/auth-deployment.md`](ai/skills/auth-deployment.md)
- Cameras, media, entity pictures, RSS, external URLs: [`/ai/skills/external-resources.md`](ai/skills/external-resources.md)
- UI/UX and dashboard behavior: [`/ai/skills/navet-ux.md`](ai/skills/navet-ux.md)
- Performance and kiosk constraints: [`/ai/skills/performance.md`](ai/skills/performance.md)

For dashboard UI work, reading `navet-ux.md` is mandatory, not optional based on task size. Before
writing JSX or styles, also inspect the exact neighboring product surface and the relevant
Storybook primitive, pattern, or card story. Use
[`/docs/design-system/AI-DESIGN-CONTEXT.md`](docs/design-system/AI-DESIGN-CONTEXT.md) as the short
reference packet; do not infer Navet's visual language from words such as "premium" or "glass."

## Repo Layout

Do not assume a repo-root `src/` directory. Navet is organized as apps and packages:

- App composition and most dashboard/runtime code: `/packages/app/src`
- Provider-neutral core contracts and runtime types: `/packages/core/src`
- Provider-neutral shared UI: `/packages/ui/src`
- Home Assistant adapter: `/packages/provider-homeassistant/src`
- Homey adapter: `/packages/provider-homey/src`
- openHAB adapter: `/packages/provider-openhab/src`
- Hubitat adapter: `/packages/provider-hubitat/src`
- SmartThings adapter: `/packages/provider-smartthings/src`
- Standalone app entrypoint: `/apps/standalone/src`
- Demo app entrypoint: `/apps/demo/src`
- Website app entrypoint: `/apps/website/src`
- Public documentation app: `/apps/docs`
- Home Assistant panel wrapper: `/apps/ha-panel`
- Storybook app: `/apps/storybook`

Path resolution rule:

- Start file discovery in `packages/` and `apps/`, not repo-root `src/`.
- Use package names and the layout above to choose the search root before running broad searches.
- Treat `packages/app/src` as the default location for shared dashboard app behavior unless the task is clearly core, shared UI, or provider-specific.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Home Assistant official documentation is the source of truth for Home Assistant adapter behavior.
- Use `/homeassistant/core` as the local implementation reference for Home Assistant edge cases,
  payload shapes, service behavior, and undocumented runtime details.
- Home Assistant documentation does not define Navet's overall architecture.
- Treat Home Assistant as one provider adapter inside Navet, not as the application architecture.
- Navet uses a package architecture direction with `@navet/core`, `@navet/ui`, provider packages,
  and `@navet/app`.
- Prefer Navet-owned contracts, provider/runtime abstractions, and normalized state for shared UI
  and shared feature work.
- `@navet/ui` must not import provider-specific code.
- `@navet/core` must not import provider-specific code, React, provider SDKs, or API clients.
- Provider-specific code belongs in provider packages or migration seams that are explicitly being
  extracted toward those packages.
- Do not add new shared-UI dependencies on `HassEntity` or other backend raw types unless the code
  is explicitly adapter-internal.
- Do not expose Home Assistant service payloads as the public UI command model.
- Prefer provider-neutral entities and commands before adding backend-specific conditionals.
- When Home Assistant behavior is unclear, check official docs first, then confirm against
  `/homeassistant/core`; do not infer behavior from Navet's current implementation.
- Do not change tests just to match the current implementation.
- Never use or suggest `git commit --no-verify`, `git push --no-verify`, or any equivalent hook-bypass flag.
- Treat `IntegrationProviderId`, `SmartHomeProviderAdapter`, `NavetEntity`, `NavetCommand`,
  `CommandResult`, provider-scoped IDs, canonical IDs, runtime, contract, capability, feature
  service, and resource resolution as the preferred architecture vocabulary.
- `NavetDevice`, `NavetRoom`, `NavetRoomDescriptor`, and `NavetProviderSnapshot` remain current
  compatibility models inside `@navet/app`; do not present them as the target public contract.
- Prefer incremental extraction over a rewrite.
- Follow [`docs/agents/commands.md`](docs/agents/commands.md) before running repo commands.

Practical Home Assistant verification:

- Inspect `/homeassistant/core/homeassistant/` for concrete implementation behavior.
- Inspect `/homeassistant/core/tests/` for regression coverage and realistic behavior examples.
- Use `/homeassistant/core` to understand Home Assistant itself, not to define Navet architecture
  or justify provider-specific code leaking into shared layers.
