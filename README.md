# Home OS

基于 [Navet](https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet) 的高级定制版家庭中控。保留 Navet 的 Provider、OAuth、WebSocket、Area/Device/Entity、摄像头、能源、PWA 和响应式架构，增加 Home OS 的中文家庭总览、房间、全部设备、中国能源、家庭机房、家庭模式、家庭成员和动态异常中心。

- 不包含 3D 户型、floorplan、GLB 或 iframe 拼接首页。
- 国家电网、山东港华、PVE 和网络数据从 Home Assistant 已标准化实体读取，不在前端保存服务凭据。
- 局域网与公网 HTTPS 部署见 [中文部署文档](deploy/README.zh-CN.md)。
- 上游仍保持 AGPL-3.0，完整归属见 [Home OS 归属说明](HOME_OS_ATTRIBUTION.md)。

下面保留 Navet 上游能力说明，便于持续同步和维护。

  <p><strong>A smart home dashboard for every screen.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Navet turns Home Assistant, Homey, or openHAB into a calmer, room-first interface<br>
    for everyday control across wall panels, tablets, desktops, and phones.

## Everyday control without admin-screen clutter

Navet keeps live state and common actions close at hand while your connected platform remains the
source of truth. Rooms, lights, climate, media, energy, security, and routines stay easy to reach
without making every household member navigate a configuration interface.

- **Room-first control.** See what matters where it happens, then act without digging through
  entity lists.
- **Familiar across screens.** Wall panels, tablets, desktops, and phones keep the same interaction
  model while the layout adapts to each screen.
- **Local by default.** Provider data, dashboard state, and credentials stay on your device or
  server—not on Navet servers.
- **Open source.** Run it yourself, inspect the code, and help shape what comes next.

## Focused controls when you need them

Open focused controls for lighting, climate, media, energy, security, and routines when your connected
platform supports them.

Shape the Home view around your household with editable layouts, dashboard profiles, widgets,
themes, wallpapers, adaptive visual effects, and localization.

## Works with the platform you already use

| Provider | Current support | Ways to run Navet |
|---|---|---|
| **Home Assistant** | Navet's broadest integration, including advanced climate, media, camera, energy, weather, calendar, notification, task, history, security, and administration services | Custom panel via HACS, Home Assistant add-on, or standalone |
| **Homey** | Rooms, realtime entities, lights, switches, and sensors | Standalone; optional additional provider when OAuth is configured |
| **openHAB** | Rooms, realtime entities, lights, switches, and sensors | Standalone; optional additional provider from Settings |

Standalone Navet can retain connections to multiple supported providers and combine selected
providers in shared dashboard collections. Capabilities are not identical: Home Assistant is the
most mature integration today. Check the
[provider capability matrix](https://docs.navet.app/integrations/) before choosing a setup for
media, cameras, energy, weather, calendars, notifications, or tasks.

Hubitat and SmartThings are planned and are not supported today. Follow the
[public roadmap](https://docs.navet.app/roadmap/) for progress.

## Choose your installation

| If you use… | Start here |
|---|---|
| Home Assistant | [Choose a custom panel, add-on, or standalone installation](https://docs.navet.app/install/home-assistant/) |
| Homey | [Connect Navet through the Homey OAuth flow](https://docs.navet.app/install/homey/) |
| openHAB | [Connect Navet to your openHAB instance](https://docs.navet.app/install/openhab/) |
| A development build | [Install Navet Dev](https://docs.navet.app/install/navet-dev/) |

Not sure which route fits? [Compare every installation option](https://docs.navet.app/install/).

## Local by default

Navet is built for self-hosted smart homes. It does not require a Navet cloud account. Provider
data, dashboard state, and credentials stay on your device or server rather than Navet servers.

Standalone Home Assistant logins are isolated per browser profile. Navet keeps each OAuth session
under `/data`, identifies the browser with an opaque `HttpOnly` cookie, and never reuses one wall
panel's Home Assistant login for another phone or panel. Signing out removes only that browser's
session; shared dashboard settings remain a separate concern from provider credentials. After the
Home Assistant authorization page closes, dashboard requests, token renewal, and provider-managed
HTTP camera resources use Navet's same-origin proxy instead of requiring every browser to reach
the container's Home Assistant address. If startup cannot restore that browser session, the
recovery screen can retry the connection or return to login for a fresh sign-in.

The Home Assistant add-on is Ingress-only so its trusted Home Assistant user headers are never
accepted from a directly exposed add-on port. Use standalone Docker for direct browser access and
per-browser OAuth sessions.

A public deployment is still a sensitive control surface. Use HTTPS, least-privilege provider
accounts, and the guidance in the [security policy](https://docs.navet.app/security/).

Please report vulnerabilities privately to `security@navet.app` rather than opening a public issue.

## Contribute to Navet

Navet is an AGPL-3.0 open-source project. Whether you want to fix a bug, improve a provider, refine
the dashboard, or document a setup, start with the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet.git
cd navet
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Prerequisites: Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`, pnpm 11, and Git.

<details>
<summary><strong>Repository architecture</strong></summary>

Navet is moving toward provider-neutral core and UI packages, provider-owned adapters, and an
official app-composition layer:

  core/                       provider-neutral contracts and runtime types

  storybook/                  shared UI review surface
```

Much of the current shared UI implementation still lives in `packages/app/src/components/*` and
`packages/app/src/ui-kit/*`; `@navet/ui` is the target shared boundary rather than a claim that the
extraction is already complete. Read the [repository documentation map](docs/README.md) before
making architecture changes.

## Disclaimers

Navet is an independent community project. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed
by Home Assistant, Homey, openHAB, or the organizations behind them. Use Navet at your own risk,
and review the installation and security guidance before connecting it to your home.

### AI-assisted development

AI tools support parts of Navet's design, implementation, documentation, review, and testing
workflow. They give maintainers more leverage across a complex codebase, but they do not set the
architecture or replace maintainer judgment. Human maintainers remain responsible for product
decisions, technical direction, and what is merged.

AI-assisted changes are held to the same review, testing, compatibility, and security expectations
as any other contribution. Provider-specific work must follow the relevant platform documentation
and behavior while preserving Navet's provider-neutral architecture. AI output can still be wrong;
please report anything that does not work as documented.
