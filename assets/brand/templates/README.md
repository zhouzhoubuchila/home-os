# Navet brand templates

These SVG templates turn the established Navet identity into repeatable working files. They use
the current hub mark geometry, system typography, `#06080d` canvas, orange identity accent,
restrained blue atmosphere, fine borders, and the rounded modular geometry seen across
`navet.app`, `docs.navet.app`, and the Navet product cards.

They are production starting points, not new brand directions. Do not recolor or redraw the mark,
substitute a display typeface, or add a campaign palette.

## Templates

| File | Canvas | Recommended use | Safe area |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| `social-announcement.svg` | 1200 × 630 | Release, feature, or project announcement | 72 px |
| `video-title-card.svg` | 1920 × 1080 | Tutorial title or chapter card | 120 px |
| `presentation-title-slide.svg` | 1920 × 1080 | Presentation cover slide | 96 px |
| `readme-banner.svg` | 1600 × 500 | Repository or project README banner | 56 px |

Each SVG includes a hidden `safe-area-guide` group. Change its `display="none"` attribute to
`display="inline"` while editing, then hide it again before export.

## Edit the content

1. Open the SVG in Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape, or a text editor.
2. Edit text only inside the `editable-content` group. Text elements and placeholder lines have
   descriptive IDs such as `editable-headline`, `editable-support`, and `editable-meta`.
3. Keep the headline to the existing number of lines. Shorten the message before reducing its
   size. Use sentence case and one concrete user outcome.
4. Replace the image inside the `product-proof` group with a current Navet screenshot or product
   crop. Keep the existing crop, rounded frame, and border. Do not reconstruct or embellish the
   dashboard.
5. Update the root `<title>` and `<desc>` so the exported SVG has an accurate accessible name.

The sample copy demonstrates hierarchy only. Verify feature, provider, privacy, release, and
numeric claims against current product sources before publishing.

## Product proof

Product imagery should come from the current, public-safe Navet demo or the approved marketing
capture library under `assets/reference/marketing/`. Prefer one readable crop over a collage.
Preserve the real card colors: those colors describe state, content, or device context and are not
a decorative campaign palette.

When inserting an image directly in SVG, keep it inside the existing clip path:

```svg
<image
  href="path/to/current-product-capture.png"
  x="0"
  y="0"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"
/>
```

Embed the image as a data URI when the finished SVG must be portable. Otherwise, export to PNG or
JPG before distribution so relative image paths cannot break.

## Logo and type

- Templates use either a locked inline lockup or an embedded byte-for-byte copy of
  `assets/public/logo-horizontal-light.svg`. Do not edit the mark contents. The repository's asset
  manifest checksums each approved template so a lockup cannot drift silently; change it only
  through explicit brand review.
- Keep clear space around the lockup equal to at least 10% of its height.
- Do not reduce the square mark below 32 px in a final digital asset.
- Keep the system stack: `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif`.
- If an editor substitutes a font, export from a platform with a native system sans or outline
  only the finished campaign text. Keep an editable source copy.

## Accessibility and contrast

- Primary text is white on the near-black canvas. Supporting text uses at least 64% white at the
  supplied sizes; do not lower its opacity.
- Orange and blue glows are atmosphere, never the only carrier of meaning.
- Keep essential text away from the product image and high-energy glow areas.
- Use the supplied type sizes as minimums for these canvases. If copy does not fit, edit the copy.
- Check the final crop at the actual display size, including a mobile social feed and a README in
  both light and dark browser themes.
- Do not put required information only in the raster image. Repeat the key outcome in live text or
  accessible alt text wherever the asset is published.

## Export

Export SVG when the destination reliably supports SVG and all linked images are embedded. For
social, video, and presentation tools, export a raster copy at the canvas's native dimensions.

From the repository root, Sharp can render a review PNG without changing the source:

```bash
node -e "import('sharp').then(({default: sharp}) => sharp('assets/brand/templates/social-announcement.svg').png().toFile('/tmp/navet-social-announcement.png'))"
```

Use PNG for type- and UI-heavy artwork. Use high-quality JPG only when a photographic background
makes the PNG unnecessarily large. Do not stretch an export to a different aspect ratio.
