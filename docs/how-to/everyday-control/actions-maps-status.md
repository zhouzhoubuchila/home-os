These widgets turn selected household actions or summaries into focused dashboard cards.

## Create an action

1. Enter edit mode and open **Add card → Widgets**.
2. Choose **Action**.
3. Select the supported target and action.
4. Give it a clear household label.
5. Choose a compact supported size and save.

Scene is a preset of the same action-widget model.

## Add a map

Choose **Map** and select available people or tracker entities. Location data stays sourced from
the connected provider.

## Add status summaries

- **Battery overview** groups low-battery state.
- **UPS monitor** summarizes supported power backup entities.
- **Energy now** shows a live energy snapshot.
- **Info** can present a compact grouped summary.

## Keep actions safe

Use clear labels and avoid creating ambiguous shortcuts for locks, alarms, or other risky commands.
The available action model is bounded by Navet and the owning provider.
