Camera capability flags alone do not guarantee that a live offer or stream will succeed. Navet
tries the supported playback plan and preserves a snapshot or error state when live playback fails.

## Check the basics

1. Confirm that the camera is available in the provider.
2. Verify that its snapshot updates.
3. Open **Settings → Interaction** and review camera live-stream behavior.
4. Reload the camera once.

## Review camera settings

Open the camera settings dialog and check:

- Preferred playback mode.
- A configured direct-stream URL, when your setup requires one.
- Whether a configured direct-stream URL is reachable from the browser running Navet.

## Understand fallback

Depending on provider support, Navet can try WebRTC, MSE, HLS, or MJPEG paths. A failed direct
WebRTC offer should fall back rather than pretending that live playback is active.

## Deployment checks

- Panel and Ingress paths can require Home Assistant resource rewriting.
- In standalone mode, Home Assistant-provided snapshots, HLS playlists, and MJPEG fallbacks use
  Navet's same-origin proxy. The browser does not need a direct route to Home Assistant for those
  resources.
- Authenticated, signed, relative, and expiring Home Assistant URLs stay on that proxy rather than
  being treated as ordinary public links.
- A custom go2rtc direct-stream URL is intentionally browser-loaded and must be reachable from the
  current browser, including across a VPN when away.
- A Home Assistant camera may advertise WebRTC even when its actual offer or source fails. Navet
  then tries the next provider-supported transport. Native WebRTC may also negotiate a media route
  that the current VPN cannot reach; HLS or MJPEG fallback remains on Navet's proxy. Verify those
  transports work in Home Assistant if every live option fails.

## Collect useful support details

Record the Navet version, installation mode, camera entity, preferred playback mode, exact visible
error, and whether snapshots work. Do not include credentials or signed URLs in a public report.
