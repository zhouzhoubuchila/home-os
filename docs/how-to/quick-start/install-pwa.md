Adding Navet to your phone's Home Screen gives it an app icon and opens it without the usual
browser controls. It continues to use your self-hosted Navet installation.

## Before you start

- Open Navet from its normal trusted address.
- Sign in and confirm that the dashboard works in the browser.
- HTTPS is normally required outside local development.

## Add Navet to your phone

### iPhone

1. Open Navet in Safari.
2. Open the Share menu.
3. Choose **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Confirm the name and choose **Add**.

### Android

1. Open Navet in a supported browser.
2. Open the browser menu.
3. Choose **Install app** or **Add to Home screen**.
4. Confirm the installation.

## Apply an update

When Navet reports that an update is ready, choose the update action and allow the app to reload.
Unsaved edits should be completed before reloading.

## If installation is not offered

- Confirm that you are using the normal Navet address rather than an embedded preview.
- Check that the address is trusted and uses HTTPS where required.
- Reload after the first successful connection.
- On Home Assistant Ingress, browser installation behavior can differ from standalone Navet.

Installing the PWA does not copy your provider or dashboard data to Navet-operated servers.
