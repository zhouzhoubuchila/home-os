Use **Wall display** for a dedicated household screen. It applies a coordinated set of settings
instead of requiring each option to be changed separately.

## Apply the preset

1. Open **Settings → Dashboard** on the display.
2. Under **Display preset**, choose **Wall display**.

The preset enables:

- Kiosk mode.
- Keep-awake.
- A clock header.
- A denser layout.
- The Home summary bar.

The preset applies to the current device. To reuse the same display behavior elsewhere, use
**Settings → System → Connected devices → Device settings** to copy it once or link a group of
screens.

## Use Navet in kiosk mode

Kiosk mode hides the normal Navet header and sidebar. Use the bottom-right **More** button to open
**Kiosk control**.

Kiosk control provides:

- Dashboards, sections, and room navigation.
- Settings and room management.
- Dashboard and sidebar customization.
- Kiosk behavior, including swipe navigation.
- A direct **Exit kiosk mode** action.

Open **Kiosk behavior** to enable **Swipe between rooms**. Swipes work on empty dashboard space so
they do not replace normal card gestures.

## Home Assistant header and sidebar

Navet kiosk mode controls Navet's own chrome. In Home Assistant-hosted modes, hiding Home
Assistant's surrounding header and sidebar also requires the optional shell module described in
the [Home Assistant installation guide](/install/home-assistant/).

## Leave kiosk mode

1. Open **Kiosk control** from the bottom-right **More** button.
2. Choose **Exit kiosk mode**.

You can also open **Settings → Dashboard** and choose the **Standard** display preset.

Keep this recovery path available before mounting a tablet where browser controls are difficult to
reach.

## If the display sleeps

Check the keep-awake status and follow
[Recover kiosk access and keep-awake](/guide/wall-displays/recovery/).
