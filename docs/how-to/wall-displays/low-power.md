Navet can reduce expensive visual effects while preserving information, layout meaning, and
controls.

![Appearance settings showing Auto, High, Medium, and Low visual quality.](/docs/how-to/wall-displays/visual-quality.webp)

## Start with Auto

1. Open **Settings → Appearance** on the low-power screen.
2. Find **Visual quality**.
3. Choose **Auto**.

ARM Linux browsers such as Raspberry Pi OS normally start in a lower-cost tier automatically.

## Choose Low manually

Use **Low** when scrolling, live updates, or dialogs remain sluggish. Low quality reduces:

- Backdrop and filter effects.
- Large or layered shadows.
- Animated transitions and ambient layers.
- Other compositor-heavy decoration.

It does not remove device state or household controls.

## Reduce motion

Use the browser or operating system's reduced-motion preference when motion is distracting or
hardware is constrained. **Low** visual quality also strips expensive transitions and ambient
effects.

## Choose whether to share the setting

Visual quality stays on the current device by default, so a wall panel can remain on **Low** while
a phone or desktop uses richer rendering. If several low-power panels should match, open
**Settings → System → Connected devices → Device settings** and create a sync group.

## Additional checks

- Prefer one browser tab dedicated to Navet.
- Avoid extremely large external room images or photo-frame sources.
- Use Default spacing if denser layouts make touch or scrolling harder.
- Confirm that the browser and display resolution match the panel.
