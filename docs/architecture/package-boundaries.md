# Package Boundaries

This is the practical ownership guide for Navet's package layout.

## Package Map

```text
packages/
  core/
  ui/
  provider-homeassistant/
  provider-homey/
  provider-openhab/
  provider-hubitat/
  provider-smartthings/
  app/
```

These package surfaces are the live runtime layout. Contributors should think in terms of package
ownership first, with `@navet/app` acting as the assembly layer that wires provider bridges,
runtime registration, settings, and persistence together.

Deployable and published host surfaces live separately under `apps/`. Those workspaces should stay
thin and consume package entry surfaces rather than owning shared feature logic.

## Ownership

| Area | Owner |
|---|---|
| shared contracts, IDs, adapter semantics | `@navet/core` |
| shared dashboard UI and view-model rendering | `@navet/ui` |
| Home Assistant runtime, mapping, auth, transport | `@navet/provider-homeassistant` |
| Homey runtime and mapping | `@navet/provider-homey` |
| openHAB runtime and mapping | `@navet/provider-openhab` |
| runtime selection, provider registration, settings, persistence | `@navet/app` |
| Hubitat and SmartThings package entry surfaces | `@navet/provider-hubitat`, `@navet/provider-smartthings` |

Compatibility types like `NavetDevice`, `NavetRoom`, and `NavetProviderSnapshot` still exist, but
they are app-internal support code. Do not treat them as the preferred shared surface.

## Allowed Dependencies

- `@navet/ui` may depend on `@navet/core`
- provider packages may depend on `@navet/core`
- `@navet/app` may depend on every Navet package

## Forbidden Dependencies

- `@navet/core` importing React, provider SDKs, auth flows, or backend clients
- `@navet/ui` importing provider packages or raw backend payload types
- provider packages importing app services, stores, auth runtimes, or infrastructure directly
- provider packages importing app-internal compatibility code as their main input model
- new shared code importing deep provider internals when a package entry already exists

## Runtime Flow

1. `@navet/app` selects the runtime mode and active provider.
2. Each connected provider package exposes normalized provider state and command execution.
3. `@navet/app` keeps provider-scoped collections and merges the selected provider collections for
   shared dashboard consumption.
4. `@navet/ui` renders from normalized entities and view models.
5. UI interactions emit generic `NavetCommand` values or call an optional provider feature
   service when the interaction needs a richer contract.
6. The matching provider package translates that work into provider-native requests.

## Provider Status

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home Assistant | implemented | first stable provider |
| Homey | implemented | standalone OAuth flow |
| openHAB | implemented | standalone base-URL and username/password flow |
| Hubitat | planned | provider contract + registration entry only |
| SmartThings | planned | provider contract + registration entry only |

Feature-service support is narrower than implementation status. Home Assistant registers the
advanced climate, media, camera, energy, calendar, weather, notification, task, history, security,
and administration services. Homey and openHAB currently register rooms, realtime entities,
lighting, switches, and sensors.

## Working Rule

If you are not sure where code belongs, ask two questions:

1. Is it generic across providers?
2. Does it need runtime, auth, transport, or raw payload knowledge?

If it is generic, it probably belongs in `@navet/core` or `@navet/ui`. If it needs provider
knowledge, it belongs in a provider package or in `@navet/app` wiring.
