Navet Dev is the frequently updated development channel for testing changes before a stable
release. It can contain unfinished features and regressions. Keep a Home Assistant backup and a
copy of important Navet dashboard configuration before switching to it.

## Choose An Installation

| Installation | Published Dev channel | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| HACS custom panel | No | Stable, Home Assistant-hosted Navet |
| Home Assistant App | Yes: main-backed `Navet Dev` | Easiest Home Assistant development build |
| Standalone Docker | Yes: `dev`, `edge`, and exact branch versions | Independent app, testing, and rollback control |

Navet Dev publishes update the Home Assistant App and Docker images. They intentionally do not publish HACS
updates. If you need the current development build inside the Home Assistant custom panel, use the
advanced manual build below or choose the `Navet Dev` App instead.

Every named clean branch can publish an immutable exact Dev version. Only a publish sourced from
`main` advances the moving `dev` and `edge` tags or the Home Assistant App store metadata.

## Home Assistant App

This is the recommended development installation for Home Assistant OS users.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant OS with Apps support
- an `amd64` or `aarch64` system

### Install

1. In Home Assistant, open `Settings -> Apps -> App store`.
2. Open the store menu, choose `Repositories`, and add:

   ```text
   https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet
   ```

3. Reload the App store if the repository does not appear immediately.
4. Open `Navet Dev` and select `Install`.
5. Start the App.
6. Enable `Show in sidebar`, or select `Open Web UI`.

The App runs through Home Assistant Ingress and reuses the authenticated parent Home Assistant
session. It does not need a Home Assistant URL or long-lived access token in normal Ingress use.

The App is Ingress-only so its trusted Home Assistant user headers are never exposed on a
directly reachable port. Use the standalone Docker app when testing the direct-access OAuth flow.

To test Homey as an additional provider, set the App's `homey_client_id`,
`homey_client_secret`, and optional `homey_redirect_uri` options, restart it, then connect Homey in
**Settings -> System**. openHAB can be added there with a container-reachable URL and credentials.

### Update

Each main-backed Navet Dev publish advances the version in the App repository. Home Assistant
will show an update when it refreshes that repository. An exact publish from another branch is not
offered by the App store until matching metadata lands on `main`.

1. Open `Settings -> Apps -> Navet Dev`.
2. Create a Home Assistant backup if the update is important to your setup.
3. Select `Update`, then restart the App.

If an update is not visible, reload the App store and check for updates again.

### Optional Home Assistant Chrome Hiding

The App cannot install Home Assistant frontend modules by itself. To let Navet hide the native
Home Assistant header and sidebar, also install the stable Navet HACS integration and add this to
`configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  extra_module_url:
    - /api/navet/static/navet-ha-shell.js
```

Restart Home Assistant after changing `configuration.yaml`. The shell module is supplied by the
HACS integration; the dashboard itself can still come from the `Navet Dev` App.

## Standalone Docker

The moving `dev` and `edge` tags point to the latest Navet Dev publication sourced from `main`. Use
`dev` unless you already standardize on `edge`. A publish from another branch is available only
through its exact immutable version.

### Requirements

- Docker with Compose support
- the credentials required by the provider you want to test
- for Home Assistant, a trusted upstream reachable from the Navet container and an authorization
  address reachable from the browser while signing in; these may be different routes to the same
  installation

### Install

Create `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  navet-dev:
    image: ghcr.io/awesomestvi/navet:dev
    container_name: navet-dev
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    environment:
      # Optional trusted Home Assistant upstream pin.
      NAVET_HASS_URL: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"
      # Optional Homey OAuth client settings.
      NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_ID: "your-athom-client-id"
      NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_SECRET: "your-athom-client-secret"
    volumes:
      - navet-dev-data:/data

volumes:
  navet-dev-data:
```

Remove any environment variables for providers you are not testing. For Home Assistant, change
`NAVET_HASS_URL` to an upstream reachable from the Navet container, or omit it and use first-run
discovery and pairing. Each browser may then enter a LAN, VPN, Tailscale, or external address for
that same Home Assistant installation. After authorization, Home Assistant API traffic, token
renewal, and provider-managed HTTP camera resources use Navet's same-origin proxy. For Homey,
register the exact callback URL described in the [Homey guide](/install/homey/). openHAB needs no
container environment variable; choose it in Navet and enter its base URL and credentials.

Start Navet Dev:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For a fresh unpinned installation, run `docker compose logs navet-dev` and open the complete Navet
URL containing `#navet_pairing=<64-character-key>` before enrolling the first provider. Then open
`http://localhost:8081` when Docker runs on this computer, or replace `localhost` with the Docker
host's LAN, VPN, or public name from another device. Port `8081` lets this Dev container run
alongside a stable Navet container using port `8080`. Navet stores provider sessions and dashboard
profile state in the `/data` volume.

### Update

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The named volume remains in place when the container is replaced.

### Pin Or Roll Back

Moving tags change with every main-backed Dev publish. For reproducible installations or testing a
non-main branch publish, replace `dev` with an exact version from a `navet-dev-*` GitHub prerelease,
for example:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/awesomestvi/navet:0.8.0-dev.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
```

Use a real published version in place of the example timestamp, then run:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

To return to stable Docker, change the image tag to `latest`.

The GitHub prerelease identifies the source branch and commit. Confirm those values before using an
exact branch build on a household dashboard.

## HACS Custom Panel

HACS installs the stable Navet custom-panel release from
`https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet-hacs`. The Navet Dev publish workflow does not update that
repository, so there is no supported `Navet Dev` HACS channel.

For the supported stable installation:

1. Add `https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet-hacs` to HACS as an `Integration` custom repository.
2. Install `Navet`.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add `Navet` from `Settings -> Devices & services`.

Do not add the main `awesomestvi/navet` monorepo to HACS. Its root is a Home Assistant App repository, not a
publishable HACS integration repository.

### Advanced: Build The Current Custom Panel Source

This path is for contributors who specifically need current source inside the Home Assistant custom
panel. It is a manual custom integration installation and will not be managed or updated by HACS.

Requirements:

- Git
- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- pnpm 11 through the repository's pinned package manager
- access to the Home Assistant `/config` directory

On a development machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet.git
cd navet
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm build:ha-panel
```

Then:

1. Stop Home Assistant and back up any existing `/config/custom_components/navet` directory.
2. Copy the contents of `platform/home-assistant/custom_components/navet/` into
   `/config/custom_components/navet/`.
3. Start Home Assistant.
4. Add or reload `Navet` from `Settings -> Devices & services`.
5. Hard-refresh the browser if it still has an older panel bundle cached.

Repeat the build and copy steps to update. Installing or redownloading Navet from HACS can replace
this manual build with the latest stable release.

## Return To Stable

- Home Assistant App: stop `Navet Dev`, install or start the stable `Navet` App, and verify its configuration.
- Docker: change `ghcr.io/awesomestvi/navet:dev` to `ghcr.io/awesomestvi/navet:latest`.
- Custom panel: install or redownload Navet from the `awesomestvi/navet-hacs` repository and restart
  Home Assistant.

Development and stable installations may not share the same storage location. Export important
dashboard configuration before switching rather than assuming it will appear in the other runtime.

## Troubleshooting

- App missing: verify the main repository URL was added to the App store, then reload it.
- Exact branch release missing from the App store: this is expected until its metadata lands on
  `main`; use the exact standalone Docker image to test it.
- Home Assistant authorization page does not open: confirm the address entered in Navet is
  reachable from the current browser, including through the intended VPN or external route.
- Home Assistant accepts authorization but returning to Navet fails: confirm `NAVET_HASS_URL`, or
  the previously paired upstream, is reachable from the Navet container; avoid `localhost` when
  Home Assistant runs on another host.
- OAuth loops after changing hostnames, TLS, reverse proxies, or ports: sign in again so Navet can
  create a session for the current Home Assistant URL.
- Custom panel still shows an older build: restart Home Assistant and hard-refresh the browser.
- HACS offers only stable versions: this is expected; use the Home Assistant App or Docker for published Dev
  builds.

For stable Home Assistant setup and runtime details, see the [Home Assistant guide](/install/home-assistant/).
