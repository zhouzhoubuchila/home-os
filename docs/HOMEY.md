Use this guide when you want Navet to connect to Homey as the primary provider in standalone mode.
The same OAuth client settings can enable Homey as an additional provider in the Home Assistant
App.

## Overview

Navet uses the Homey cloud OAuth flow. You run Navet yourself, configure an Athom Web API client,
and sign in through the provider picker.

## When To Choose This Path

Choose this path when:

- you want Navet in standalone mode
- you use Homey as the provider
- you are comfortable creating an Athom Web API client

## Prerequisites

You need:

- a Homey Cloud app or client from Athom
- the generated client ID and client secret for that app

Start here:

- [Homey Developer Tools](https://tools.developer.homey.app/)
- [Homey Web API documentation](https://api.developer.homey.app/)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create the Homey API client

1. Sign in to the Homey Developer Tools with the Athom account you want to use for Navet.
2. Create a new Web API client.
3. Set the client name to something recognizable such as `Navet`.
4. Set the redirect URL to the exact Navet callback URL that should receive the OAuth callback.
   Example: `http://localhost:8080/__navet_homey__/callback` for local Docker,
   `https://navet.example.com/__navet_homey__/callback` for a hosted deployment.
5. Save the client.
6. Copy the generated client ID and client secret.

### 2. Configure Navet

Use this `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  navet:
    image: ghcr.io/awesomestvi/navet:latest
    container_name: navet
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - navet-data:/data
    environment:
      NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_ID: your-athom-client-id
      NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_SECRET: your-athom-client-secret
      # Optional: set this only if Navet cannot infer the public callback URL correctly.
      NAVET_HOMEY_REDIRECT_URI: https://your-navet-url.example.com/__navet_homey__/callback

volumes:
  navet-data:
```

Set `NAVET_HOMEY_REDIRECT_URI` only when Navet cannot infer the public callback URL correctly,
such as when Navet sits behind a reverse proxy or the public callback URL differs from the browser
origin users open. Navet also supports a custom callback path if you register a different exact URL
with Athom, such as `https://navet.example.com/callback`.

For the Home Assistant App, set the corresponding `homey_client_id`, `homey_client_secret`, and
optional `homey_redirect_uri` App options, restart the App, then connect Homey from
**Settings -> System** inside Navet.

### 3. Start Navet

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For the first Homey enrollment, run `docker compose logs navet`, copy the Navet URL containing
`#navet_pairing=<64-character-key>`, and open that complete URL once. Navet removes the key from
the address immediately. The key authorizes the first provider enrollment; it is not a Homey
credential and is not needed again while the `navet-data` volume is preserved.

### 4. Sign in

1. Open Navet.
2. Choose `Homey` on the provider screen.
3. Continue to Athom sign-in.
4. Return to Navet after the OAuth redirect.
5. If your Athom account has more than one Homey, choose the one this dashboard should use.

## What To Expect

- Navet stores the Homey session through same-origin runtime endpoints in the Navet app.
- Homey devices and zones load after sign-in.
- The current Homey runtime contributes rooms, realtime entities, lighting, switches, and sensors.
  Climate, media, cameras, energy, calendar, weather, notifications, tasks, history, security, and
  provider-administration feature services are not registered for Homey yet.
- In a standalone installation, Homey can stay connected alongside Home Assistant or openHAB;
  selected providers are combined in shared dashboard collections.
- You do not need to enter a separate Homey base URL.
- If you sign out from Navet, the stored Homey session is cleared from the Navet side.

## Troubleshooting

- If the `Homey` option does not appear on the login screen, check that
  `NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_ID` and `NAVET_HOMEY_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in the running Navet container.
- If Navet says operator pairing is required, reopen the one-time pairing URL from the container
  log. Preserve the `navet-data` volume so enrolled providers remain trusted across updates.
- If sign-in returns to the wrong URL, set `NAVET_HOMEY_REDIRECT_URI` to the exact callback URL
  registered in your Athom Web API client.
- If Navet keeps asking you to choose a Homey again, confirm the selected Homey is still available
  to the signed-in Athom account.
