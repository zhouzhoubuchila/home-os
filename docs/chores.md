Household chores keeps recurring home work in the same calm, shared interface as the rest of
Navet. The **Today** view answers four questions first: what needs doing, who should do it, when it
is due, and whether it is finished.

![Household Today with the one-row House pulse, overdue and upcoming chore cards, assignees, time, points, and the See rewards action.](/docs/how-to/everyday-control/household-today.webp)

Chores belong to the Navet installation. They are not copied from Home Assistant todo lists, and a
connected provider does not become the source of truth for assignments, schedules, or history.
Home Assistant can optionally receive a compact summary and action requests for automations.

## Where chores are available

Native chores are available in the Home Assistant add-on and in standalone Navet when it is paired
with a trusted Home Assistant installation. The Home Assistant custom panel does not provide the
shared file store required by the chores workspace. Homey-only and openHAB-only installations do
not currently provide that storage authority.

## The Household workspace

- **Today** puts overdue and due work before later chores. The one-row **House pulse** shows earned
  points, streak, completion, and a **See rewards** action without another progress bar.
- **Chores** is the searchable library for creating, editing, pausing, duplicating, and archiving
  recurring work.
- **Missions** and **Rewards** manage optional shared goals without changing the underlying chore
  workflow. Their supporting cards stay out of Today until **See rewards** is opened.
- **Progress** shows contributions and a weekly review without ranking the household.
- **Settings** manages people, motivation style, backups, restore, and recovery.
- **Routines** keeps provider automations, scenes, and scripts available beside native chores.

Chores are enabled by default. **Settings → Dashboard → Household chores** can hide or restore the
feature, its Home summary, and room chore surfaces without deleting chore definitions or history.

## Reading a chore card

The card header keeps the room and timing state above the chore title. Time and points sit together
at the top right; optional instructions use the middle; the assignee and the smaller secondary
**Mark done** action stay in the footer. Overdue work uses a red border and status treatment.
Completed work remains visible in a smaller card with a green earned-points badge and no time tag.

Active chores receive one of twelve stable automatic colour palettes from the chore ID, so a chore
keeps its colour without tying it to the dashboard accent. Choose **Edit → Card color** to override
the automatic colour. Completed and overdue state colours always take priority over that override.

## People and shared screens

A person in Household is a lightweight workflow profile. Profiles make assignment, completion,
approval, reminders, and activity understandable, but selecting a person from **Using this screen**
is not an account sign-in.

Every household keeps at least one manager. Managers can change people and chore definitions,
approve work, manage data, and optionally protect those changes with a management PIN. Ordinary
completion actions remain available on a shared screen after a PIN is configured.

## Assignment and schedules

A chore can belong to one person, be open to anyone, create one occurrence for everyone, or rotate
between selected people. Schedules support one-time, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly,
monthly, and after-completion recurrence. Navet stores the local due time and time zone so the
schedule remains stable through daylight-saving changes.

Optional approval separates “marked done” from final completion. Missed-work rules can skip an
occurrence, carry it forward, or leave it visible for review. Pausing a chore stops new occurrences
without deleting completed history.

## Motivation is optional

Core chores work with motivation turned off. **Light points**, **Family goals**, and
**Child-friendly adventure** add progressively more feedback while keeping assignments and
completion history unchanged. Missions and rewards are supporting surfaces, not prerequisites for
using Today.

## Data, history, and recovery

Chore changes are shared across authenticated Navet screens connected to the same installation.
Revision checks prevent one screen from silently overwriting a newer household change. Activity
history supports weekly review and JSON or CSV export.

Use **Settings → Data and recovery** to download a complete backup. Restoring with **Merge** keeps
the current workspace and remaps conflicts; **Replace** removes the current workspace before the
backup is restored. A damaged workspace keeps its saved file unchanged while Navet offers retry,
last-known-good recovery, and an explicit start-over path.
