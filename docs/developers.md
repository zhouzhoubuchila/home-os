description: Contribute to Navet and understand where shared and provider-specific work belongs.

Navet is organized as a pnpm workspace with deployable applications under `apps/` and product,
provider, core, and UI packages under `packages/`.

## Set up the repository

Use the [contributing guide](/developers/contributing/) for prerequisites, local development, and
validation expectations.

## Architecture direction

- `@navet/core` owns provider-neutral contracts, IDs, and runtime semantics.
- `@navet/ui` is the target boundary for provider-neutral shared React UI.
- Provider packages own provider authentication, transport, mapping, and command translation.
- `@navet/app` owns product composition, runtime selection, settings, and persistence.

Home Assistant is the reference adapter, not the application architecture. New shared work should
depend on Navet-owned contracts rather than raw provider payloads.

The app can retain multiple implemented provider sessions and aggregate selected provider
collections. Home Assistant currently owns the advanced feature-service set; Homey and openHAB
currently cover rooms, realtime entities, lighting, switches, and sensors. Keep implementation
status separate from feature parity in code, tests, and docs.

Detailed maintainer, architecture, testing, release, and AI-agent documents remain available in the
[repository documentation](https://github.com/awesomestvi/navet/tree/main/docs) without being added
to the public navigation automatically.
