## Repo Map

Search `packages/` and `apps/` first. Do not assume a repo-root `src/` directory.

- `packages/app/src`: app composition, dashboard behavior, runtime wiring, services, tests, and stories
- `packages/core/src`: provider-neutral contracts, IDs, runtime semantics, and feature models
- `packages/ui/src`: target provider-neutral shared UI package boundary
- `packages/provider-homeassistant/src`: Home Assistant adapter behavior
- `packages/provider-homey/src`: Homey adapter behavior
- `packages/provider-openhab/src`: openHAB adapter behavior
- `apps/standalone/src`: standalone runtime entrypoint
- `apps/demo/src`: demo runtime entrypoint
- `apps/website/src`: website runtime entrypoint
- `apps/docs`: public documentation site; its content config explicitly selects publishable Markdown
- `apps/ha-panel`: Home Assistant panel wrapper/build surface
- `apps/storybook`: Storybook host app
- `platform/home-assistant/`: add-on and custom-component release surfaces

Shared UI reality check:

- `@navet/ui` is the target provider-neutral shared UI boundary.
- `packages/app/src/components/*` and `packages/app/src/ui-kit/*` are still current implementation
  and stable import surfaces.
- Docs should distinguish current implementation, stable imports, and target ownership.
